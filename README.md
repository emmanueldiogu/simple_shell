## What is a Shell?

It is a user program which provides an interface to user to use operating system service.

## How Shell Works

* User enters a command
* parsing/tokenization
* check for special characters like **|** **>**
* Check for built-in commands
* if pipes are present, handle pipes, if redirects, handle
* if wild cards, handle
* Execute system commands
* print output
